/etc/init.d/unicorn_realestate: 24: kill: No such process

Killing processes in UNIX
-------------------------
If you do not know the PID of a process, you can learn it by issuing a process status command, ps.

```shell
ps aux | grep unicorn
```

Terminate the processes with pids 1412 and 1157:

```shell
$ kill 1412 1157
```

Deploy
1. kill process unicorn 0
2. cap deploy:cold
